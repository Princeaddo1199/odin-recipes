    <h2>Ingredients Needed</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 Tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 Large Onions (Based on how you like onions) </li>
        <li>6 Garlic cloves</li>
        <li>1 Bell pepper (half red and half orange and half green)</li>
        <li>Shrimp Powder</li>
        <li></li>
        <li>1 cup of oil of your choice</li>
        <li>2 Sachet of Tomato Paste</li>
        <li>Ginger</li>
        <li>Carrots</li>
        <li>5 Cups of Basmati Rice (Washed)</li>
        <li>Mixed spices</li>
        <li>Bay leaves 2</li>
        <li>Meat of your choice (I prefer goat meat) </li>
        <li>Water</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To make this rice, start by washing the rice until the water runs clear. Set the rice aside. Next, chop the onions, wash, and drain. Set and aside. </li>

        <li>Peel the garlic and set aside.Cut half of the bell peppers and remove the seeds. Drain the tomatoes and set aside.Next, blend the onions and garlic with ¼ up water. Blend the ingredients until smooth. Pour the onion mixture into a bowl and set aside. </li>

        <li>Blend the tomatoes and peppers. Be sure to remove the seeds from the bell peppers. Blend to a smooth consistency. </li>

        <li>In a large saucepan, add 1 cup of oil. When heated through, add the onion mixture over medium high heat. Stir well. Continue stirring and cooking for 5 minutes.Reduce the heat to medium. Add the tomato paste, continue to stir until well incorporated. Continue to cook for an additional 5 minutes. </li>

        <li>Add the seasoning (ginger, salt, bay leaves, and curry powder) stir well to combine, then add the tomato mixture and shrimp powder. Stir well to combine, cover, and cook for an additional 20 minutes. Be sure to stir occasionally to avoid burning.Meanwhile add 1 cup of water to the blender. Stir the water around so that the remaining tomato and onion are incorporated in the water. Set it aside. </li>

        <li>After 3 minutes remaining, pour the water mixture in the tomato mixture. Stir well. Work fast as you do not want the tomato mixture to splash too much.After the 20 minutes are up (remaining 3 minutes), add the rice. Stir well to combine.</li>

        <li>Reduce the heat to medium low, cover the rice with parchment paper, then with the lid to allow the steam to fully cook the rice. Stir the rice every 3 to five minutes to avoid burning at the bottom. Once the water has completely evaporated, the rice should be nice and fluffy. Garnish with bell peppers and serve well. Enjoy. </li>

        <li>The last part of making Ghanaian jollof rice is the vegetables, although it is optional, and it’s all about stirring a mixture of vegetables, including peas, green beans, and carrots. </li>

        <li>While these vegetables are a common part of jollof rice, they were added to improve the nutritional profile of the rice – these vegetables make the bright addition to the dish.</li>

        <li>In addition to these vegetables, you can also add eggplants, tubers like potatoes and cassava, and cabbage. However, these latter vegetables are commonly used in the Sahel and thieboudienne regions of West Africa. </li>
